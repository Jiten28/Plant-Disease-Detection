Plant Disease Detection

Hello everyone. My project focuses on using machine learning to detect plant diseases quickly and accurately. Traditional visual inspections are slow and labor-intensive, so I'm leveraging machine learning to automate the process. This approach aims to improve crop health, increase yields, and promote sustainable agriculture.

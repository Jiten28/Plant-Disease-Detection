# Plant-Disease-Detection
Plant Disease Detection

Hello everyone. My project focuses on using machine learning to detect plant diseases quickly and accurately. Traditional visual inspections are slow and labor-intensive, so I'm leveraging machine learning to automate the process. This approach aims to improve crop health, increase yields, and promote sustainable agriculture.

In order to run this program you first need to install some modules:
    • Tensorflow 
        (pip install tensorflow)
    • Matplotlib
        (pip install matplotlib)
    • sSeaborn
        (pip install seaborn)
    • pandas
        (pip install pandas)
    • Keras
        (pip install keras)

In order to run the web application we are using streamlite
    • streamlit
        (pip install streamlit)

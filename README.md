## **Plant Disease Detection**  
**Revolutionizing Agriculture with Machine Learning**

### **Overview**  
Plant Disease Detection is a machine learning-powered project aimed at identifying plant diseases with speed and accuracy. Traditional methods of visual inspection are time-consuming and labor-intensive, often leading to delayed interventions. This project automates the detection process, promoting healthier crops, increasing agricultural yields, and supporting sustainable farming practices.

### **Key Features**  
- **Disease Detection with Machine Learning**: Utilizes deep learning models to analyze images of plants and diagnose diseases.  
- **Web Application Interface**: Powered by Streamlit for easy accessibility and user-friendly interaction.  
- **Data Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for presenting results and trends in a visual format.  
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed to accommodate diverse crops and diseases.
